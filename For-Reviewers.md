Optional Enhancements for Reviewers

1. Error Handling Approach
	•	The API ensures proper HTTP status codes:
	•	400 Bad Request for invalid inputs.
	•	500 Internal Server Error for unexpected issues.
	•	Can be extended with structured error responses.

2. Thread Safety Considerations
	•	Since UUID ensures unique risk creation, sync.Mutex was not required in CreateRisk().
	•	Read operations are simple and do not require locks.
	•	If moving to SQL, proper transaction handling should be used.

3. Interface-Driven Architecture
	•	All core logic is decoupled through interfaces.
	•	Any future database implementation (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) can be swapped in by implementing repository methods.

4. Scalability Considerations
	•	Adding Redis or a relational DB would improve reliability.

5. **Risk Uniqueness**: Risks are not unique on any parameter other than the auto-generated UUID, as per the requirements.

6. Implement API authentication.
